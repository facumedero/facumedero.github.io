Committed to personal growth, predisposed to new challenges, great team worker, excellent adaptability to any environment.
This is a testing page to learn about a bit more than css and Jekyll. It's responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="\_blank"}.

In the social-icons footer stay my links profiles from GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. Bye Bye!
